## About the project

---

This project was created as part of the ISDI Coders Bootcamp precourse. The goal was to create a game that works in the same way the hit Spanish TV game show does. Users are presented with a letter wheel. During the game, users are given a letter and a question and the answer to the question normally starts with that letter. If the answer is correct, the letter turns green, otherwise it turns red if they get it wrong. Users can skip a question and come back to it later by saying the word "pasapalabra".

There's keyboard support for submitting an answer and skipping an answer(pasapalbra):

| Button        | Keyboard         |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Submit answer | <kbd>Enter</kbd> |
| Pasapalabra   | <kbd>tab</kbd>   |

### Built with

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript

### What I learned

This project really gave me a chance to start understanding CSS and how it works. I tried my best to make the website responsive and got the opportunity to use FlexBox and use media queries. I also had the opportunity to solidify my knowledge of JavaScript and apply it. I had to learn about DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

### Possible next steps

-   Improve sizing of project by using percentages and rem/em measurements
-   Add more user feedback for their answers, at the moment the only feedback is the letter changing colour
